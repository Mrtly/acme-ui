# Icon

**`<Icon>`** is a reuseable component representing all icons in the library.

The specific icon is selected by the `name` property.

Refer to **[All Icons](/docs/theme-icons--docs)** for a list of icon names.

**`<Icon>`** size:
- `sm` (16px)
- `md` (20px)
- `lg` (24px)
- `xl` (30px)

### Usage

<Source code={` import { Icon } from '@ppl-gds/ui' 

<Icon name="Circle" size="md" />`} />

### Accessibility

By default, an `<Icon>` has the `aria-hidden={true}` property.

An `aria-label` can be provided by the `ariaLabel` prop, that renders the icon visible to screen-readers.

`ariaLabel` should only be added to implementations where the icon is used to convey semantic meaning or useful feedback to the user.

### Color

By default, Icos inherit the `currentColor` - with the exception of the `PPL` Icons that default to a color.

Add a color to an `<Icon>` through the `className="text-{color}"` property.
