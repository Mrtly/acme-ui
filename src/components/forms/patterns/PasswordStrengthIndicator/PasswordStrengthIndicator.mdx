# PasswordStrengthIndicator

A **`<PasswordStrengthIndicator>`** to be used with the [PasswordField](/docs/forms-fields-passwordfield--docs) in forms that create or change a password. It visually represents the strength level of the password provided.

This element provides visual and accessible feedback for a password form, but does not implement form validation. The form validation is handled separately, by the Form setup with the appropriate Zod validation schema.

The required rules listed in this element match the rules enforced by the `PasswordFieldSchemaForStrengthIndicator` that should be used for the password field used in password create/change forms.

Refer to the [PasswordField documentation](/docs/forms-fields-passwordfield--docs) for more examples on how to use this component.

<Canvas of={PasswordStrengthIndicatorStories.Default} />

## Usage

<Source code={`import { PasswordStrengthIndicator } from '@acme/ui'

<PasswordStrengthIndicator password={password} />
`} />

## Props notes

- `password`: `string`: required - the password input
